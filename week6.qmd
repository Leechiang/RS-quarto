# Week 6 Classification I

## Summary

### Classification and regression trees (CART)
CART (Classification and Regression Trees) is a decision tree approach for solving classification and regression issues. To construct the tree, the data is recursively divided into smaller subsets and simple models are built on each. Each node in the tree represents a characteristic, each branch represents a potential value for that feature, and the leaf nodes include either categories (for classification problems) or numerical values (for regression problems).

#### Classification tree
Classification trees partition the dataset recursively using predictor variables to maximise the purity of the resulting subsets, utilising impurity measurements such as Gini impurity. Unlike regression trees, they use impurity measures to identify optimal splits. Gini impurity evaluates the likelihood of misclassifying a randomly chosen sample if labelled according to the class distribution in a subset. The splitting criterion chooses the predictor variable and split point with the lowest Gini impurity in the resulting subsets. This recursive operation continues until the halting criteria are met, yielding a tree structure with each leaf node representing a class label.

## Applications
As it mentioned in the lecture, GEE is a powerful research tool which enables us to deal with massive geospatial data without spending a lot of time. Moreover, the applications of GEE varies a lot in different fields.For instance, the graph below categorizes the applications of GEE (Haifa Tamiminia et al., 2020):

For example, a research (M. Mohammadi and M. Akhoondzadeh, 2023) had used the Google Earth Engine platform to validate NASA's assertion of a methane cloud near Southern Tehran. Through spatiotemporal analysis of daily data from the TROPOMI sensor, it was confirmed that landfills are the dominant source of methane emissions. As a result, the discovery proved the veracity of NASA's report, owing mostly to the presence of a landfill in the vicinity. Therefore, the Google Earth Engine platform emerges as a valuable tool for tracking daily, monthly, and annual differences. In addition, Daeng and his colleagues (Daeng Achmad Suaidi et al., 2023) used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse Landsat 8 satellite images, successfully tracking the land surface temperature of the Arjuno-Welirang volcanic complex between 2016 and 2021. The data demonstrated a considerable increase in surface temperature in the crater area in 2018, which coincided with increased seismic activity reported by the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia (VSI). This highlights GEE's ability in accurately tracking volcanic activity with readily available satellite data.

## Reflections
GEE is really a efficient tool! It really take less time when I was doing PCA comparing to previous weeks. However, when I run the code in GEE, it always ran the whole code instead of certain trunk. In addition, as it mentioned in the application parts, the GEE got different kinds of applications but the limitations of GEE is quite severe, too. Therefore, it is quite important for us to choose appropriate tools when doing research. When the research is related to SAR data, GEE might not be applicable.
