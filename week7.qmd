# Week 7 Classification II

## Summary

### Object based image analysis (OBIA)
Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is an advanced analytical method for remote sensing images that identifies ground features by segmenting images into several objects and taking into account their spatial and spectral properties. Common superpixel approaches, such as the SLIC algorithm, may generate representative objects, while software packages like Supercells allow for variable parameter adjustments. OBIA also includes feature extraction and classification steps, which combine average spectral values with other morphological data to classify objects. Furthermore, more advanced technologies, such as SegOptim, can incorporate other algorithms, expanding segmentation and classification possibilities to improve OBIA capability. In summary, OBIA effectively detects land features using object-level analysis and processing, providing critical support for geographical information systems and other domains.

### Sub pixel analysis
When performing subpixel analysis in urban environments, it is critical to consider factors such as pixel mixing, suitable endmember selection, and computing complexity. The V-I-S model simplifies land cover classification, whereas multiple endmember spectral analysis (MESMA) calculates the fraction of each land cover type inside pixels. These methods, which take into account computational resources and spectrum libraries, improve the accuracy and usability of subpixel analysis, allowing for better urban land cover monitoring and mapping. Subpixel analysis is critical in metropolitan environments due to different land cover types and complex spatial distributions, which frequently result in mixed land cover within pixels. It delivers exact land cover data for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management.

### Accuracy assessment
Accuracy assessment is a critical job used to evaluate the performance of classification models. In this phase, we concentrate on Producer Accuracy (PA) and User Accuracy (UA), which reflect the consistency of classification results with ground truth data, as well as the usability of classification findings for users. The Kappa coefficient, a commonly used statistic, seeks to assess the consistency of classification results with random results, taking into account random agreement and offering a standardised value. While the Kappa coefficient has positives, it is also criticised for its great complexity and susceptibility to class imbalances. To summarise, the suitable metrics are determined by the unique application and data properties. 

### Practical result
The practical for this week is also focused on the classification but with the method of OBIA and Sub-pixel.However, I found out that the results of these two methods varies a lot.The screenshot below is the result of sub-pixel:

It can be viewed that the forest is scattered in the whole area (Green) while the bare

The reason causes this huge difference can be concluded that:
The data might not be taken properly. To be instance, I took 7 polygons for each land cover. However, as I mentioned in last week, it is hard for me to identify what land cover it is  when I was drawing especially for tree and grass. And the OBIA analysis the areas with shapes and identify the landcover types by the properties of each shape, so the areas with similar properties might be identified as the same. In this case, the area of grass and forest might be identified as the same. Also, from the original image of study area (Daressalaam), it can be viewed that the bare earth and urban are surrounded with grass and forest, so it may cause errors when doing the classification.
However, in my point of view, I think that sub-pixel method might be more applicable to this case. The specific accuracy analysis should be used in order to give out the result as we've done last week.

## Applications
In this week, we've introduced the classification methods of OBIA and sub-pixel. However, it troubles me that how to determine whether OBIA and sub-pixel analysis to use. In addition, a research which done by Sumbal, Shah and their colleagues(Sumbal Bahar Saba et al., 2022), had investigated investigate and assessed the advantages and disadvantages of pixel, sub-pixel, and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)-based approaches for identifying co-seismic landslides in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan.


## Reflections
Once again, GEE is a very powerful tool. I couldn't imagine how time consuming we do remote sensed data classification in R. Moreover, CART and RF are very interesting because it can be used in many different fields, we also learnt about them in Data science module but in Data science we focused more on regression but classification in this module. For me, as it mentioned in application, it is important to choose the right machine learning algorithm because all of them can be better at accuracy and interpretability.However, further learning should be applied because it occurred overfitting when I was doing the practical though I've redraw my polygons for severral times, the accuracy results show 100%.
