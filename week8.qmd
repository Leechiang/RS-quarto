# Week 8 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data

## Summary

### SAR data
There are several types of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, including power scale, amplitude scale, and dB scale, each of them provides distinct insights on surface properties.

For instance, when choosing SAR data, it is important to consider the target detection goal, such as recognizing surface roughness or material volume and geographical factors. Different types of SAR data can be suitable for different ambitions, for example, amplitude scale is suitable for visualization and dB scale is for dark pixel differences. Therefore, choosing the appropriate SAR data ensure effective analysis according to objectives and environmental circumstances.

### Identify changes with SAR data
There are four common methods for identifying changes in SAR images: mean ratio images, log ratio images, improved ratio log ratio images, and original ratio images. Mean ratio images show changes by calculating the ratio of mean values from corresponding neighborhoods in two photos while log ratio images make changes more visible by taking the natural logarithm of the pixel value ratio between the two images.    In addition, improved ratio log ratio images use improved ratio techniques and logarithmic transformation to increase sensitivity to changes and reduce dynamic range. Then, the original ratio images entail directly computing the pixel value ratio between two photos.

Moreover, with the high temporal nature of SAR data, we can also identify the changes through t-tests and standard deviations. However, SAR data often do not follow a normal distribution, but rather gamma or other skewed distributions, making typical statistical tests difficult to apply. To solve this, data transformation or non-parametric testing techniques might be used. Change detection in SAR data is often performed using continuous change detection algorithms that do not rely on specific data distribution assumptions.   As a result, while working with SAR data, it is critical to use proper statistical methods and carefully analyse the data features to ensure reliable analysis results.
 

### Practical result
The practical for this week is also focused on the classification but with the method of OBIA and Sub-pixel.However, I found out that the results of these two methods varies a lot.The screenshot below is the result of sub-pixel:

It can be viewed that the forest is scattered in the whole area (Green) while the bare earth (Grey) and Urban (Pink) owns the most proportion.However, the result of OBIA shows that the forest and grass are the majority land covers in the study area.

The reason causes this huge difference can be concluded that:
The data might not be taken properly. To be instance, I took 7 polygons for each land cover. However, as I mentioned in last week, it is hard for me to identify what land cover it is  when I was drawing especially for tree and grass. And the OBIA analysis the areas with shapes and identify the landcover types by the properties of each shape, so the areas with similar properties might be identified as the same. In this case, the area of grass and forest might be identified as the same. Also, from the original image of study area (Daressalaam), it can be viewed that the bare earth and urban are surrounded with grass and forest, so it may cause errors when doing the classification.
However, in my point of view, by comparing the results with the actual land cover, I think that sub-pixel method might be more applicable to this case. The specific accuracy analysis should be used in order to give out the result as we've done last week.

## Applications
In this week, we've introduced the classification methods of OBIA and sub-pixel. However, it troubles me that how to determine whether OBIA and sub-pixel analysis to use especially when I had done the practical which the results of the two methods varied a lot. After searching relevant literature and research, I found a research which done by Sumbal, Shah and their colleagues(Sumbal Bahar Saba et al., 2022), had investigated investigate and assessed the advantages and disadvantages of pixel, sub-pixel, and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA)-based approaches for identifying co-seismic landslides in Muzaffarabad, Pakistan. They found out that the accuracy of sub-pixel method is 90.9% while the one of OBIA is 91.4%.

For instance, they've indicated that when using OBIA, high resolution images might be required while sub-pixel is a more cost-efficient way. Therefore, I inferred that OBIA and sub-pixel own their pros and cons but OBIA can get high accuracy with high resolution images while the one of sub-pixel can perform well in medium resolution images. Moreover, a research (Y. Gao and J.F. Mas, no date)had compared the performance of OBIA and sub-pixel in four different resolutions, they concluded that OBIA has advantages on dealing high resolution images and the advantages become more and more significant with the increase of resolutions.


## Reflections
The lecture for this week indeed took me some time to get understand especially for the accuracy part because I think it is the most important part due to the fact that if we cannot figure out the most suitable method for doing the classification, the most convincing way is to use accuracy test to evaluate different methods. However, as I have mentioned several time in this week and a couple weeks before, it been a challenge for me to identify the land covers when drawing polygons, I know that it works better when I zoom in but then the polygons might be too small then the accuracy would be affected when we use pixel based methods. Although I encounter many challenges using GEE but I really enjoy it cause it is a really sufficient application.
