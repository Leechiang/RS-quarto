# Week 8 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data

## Summary

### SAR data
There are several types of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, including power scale, amplitude scale, and dB scale, each of them provides distinct insights on surface properties.

For instance, when choosing SAR data, it is important to consider the target detection goal, such as recognizing surface roughness or material volume and geographical factors. Different types of SAR data can be suitable for different ambitions, for example, amplitude scale is suitable for visualization and dB scale is for dark pixel differences. Therefore, choosing the appropriate SAR data ensure effective analysis according to objectives and environmental circumstances.

### Identify changes with SAR data
There are four common methods for identifying changes in SAR images: mean ratio images, log ratio images, improved ratio log ratio images, and original ratio images. Mean ratio images show changes by calculating the ratio of mean values from corresponding neighborhoods in two photos while log ratio images make changes more visible by taking the natural logarithm of the pixel value ratio between the two images.    In addition, improved ratio log ratio images use improved ratio techniques and logarithmic transformation to increase sensitivity to changes and reduce dynamic range. Then, the original ratio images entail directly computing the pixel value ratio between two photos.

Moreover, with the high temporal nature of SAR data, we can also identify the changes through t-tests and standard deviations. However, SAR data often do not follow a normal distribution, but rather gamma or other skewed distributions, making typical statistical tests difficult to apply. To solve this, data transformation or non-parametric testing techniques might be used. Change detection in SAR data is often performed using continuous change detection algorithms that do not rely on specific data distribution assumptions.   As a result, while working with SAR data, it is critical to use proper statistical methods and carefully analyse the data features to ensure reliable analysis results.
 

### Practical result
The practical this week is really interesting, we investigated how the Beirut was changed before and after the blast on August 4th 2020 with Sentinel-1 images. Furthermore, the analysis is done by using t-test and standard deviation. To be more specific, the standard deviation was used to measure the degree of variation in pixel values, the higher the standard deviation, the wider the fluctuation range of pixel values. In addition, the T test was then performed to see if there were any significant differences in the mean value of image pixel values before and after the blast, and the ratio of mean difference to standard deviation was determined to assess whether the changes were statistically significant.

The screenshot below shows the result of the changes. Blue indicates no damage while red means high damages.

Surprisingly, the result of our analysis shows that number of damaged buildings we estimated only have 8% of difference with the one estimated by the U.N. Although the result is very promising and interesting, the author also had mentioned the limitations such as that some of the damages of buildings can not be captured from the view of satellites. Moreover, I think that the result should be further validated because it cannot be ensured that the damaged buildings we estimated were actually damaged, instead, the change we found might related to other factors despite the fact that we've take mean value but the potential errors cannot be neglected. However, the best way to validate is to have an actual site visit to compare the estimate result and real situation. But it is time and money consuming. As the author concluded, the blast is a three-dimensional problem, but the images we used are two-dimensional. 

## Applications
The practical this week really enables me to be curious about the application we can do with SAR data. After digging in, I found some innovative research. A research which done by Donato and his colleague (Donato Amitrano et al., 2024) investigated flood detection approaches employing SAR imagery. The analysis focuses on main flood detection technologies, performance evaluation criteria, and publicly available SAR datasets. Discussing the applications and limitations of SAR-based flood detection in various situations. Specifically, in vegetated and urban regions, where complicated scattering mechanisms may influence the precision of water extraction:

To deal with these problems, recommendations include developing tools for fair comparison and extensive technique validation, as well as investigating complementary remote sensing technologies such as Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R). Both the research and the practical had mentioned about the accuracy of the identification of changes, in the practical we've mentioned that the influences of blast we estimated may have include that caused by other factors, while the research had indicated that when SAR used in specific scenarios, the reflection might be affected by vegetation. Therefore, it is important to identify the changes with proper images. In addition, Wenjie and Yanping had (Wenjie Shen et al., no date) carried out a method called SAR-shift in which provides a new change detection algorithm for spaceborne SAR time-series data using SAR-SIFT-Logarithm Background Subtraction. It first pre-processes the input time series data, which includes noise reduction and radiometric calibration.  It then uses SAR-SIFT coregistration to protect detection performance from mismatches in order to extract the static background, areas that don't change over time are found using a median filter. In comparison to existing pairwise comparison approaches, the suggested method detects overall change information more effectively and takes less time to process. In comparison, what we had done in the practical, we used standard deviation and t-test to evaluate the changes. Further development should be done to know which one is better.
