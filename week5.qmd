# Week 5 Google Earth Engine

## Summary

### What is Google Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine is a useful geographic data processing engine. It makes optimal use of server-side processing and distributed computing to let users handle and analyse massive amounts of geographical data. It makes better use of computational resources by processing data using mapping functions rather than loops. Because of this functionality, Google Earth Engine is one of the most popular systems for handling massive amounts of geospatial data.

### What can we do with GEE
In Google Earth Engine (GEE), we may execute geometric operations, dataset joins, zonal statistics, data filtering, apply machine learning and TensorFlow deep learning algorithms, make online visualisations, and create scalable geospatial apps using GEE data.

### Practical result
The types of remote sensing can be divided into passive and active. Passive sensors collect radiation emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Active sensors, on the other hand, emits energy to scan objects and areas, after which a sensor detects and measures the radiation reflected or backscattered by the target.

## Applications
As it mentioned in the lecture, GEE is a powerful research tool which enables us to deal with massive geospatial data without spending a lot of time. Moreover, the applications of GEE varies a lot in different fields. For example, a research (M. Mohammadi and M. Akhoondzadeh, 2023) had used the Google Earth Engine platform to validate NASA's assertion of a methane cloud near Southern Tehran. Through spatiotemporal analysis of daily data from the TROPOMI sensor, it was confirmed that landfills are the dominant source of methane emissions. As a result, the discovery proved the veracity of NASA's report, owing mostly to the presence of a landfill in the vicinity. Therefore, the Google Earth Engine platform emerges as a valuable tool for tracking daily, monthly, and annual differences.

Extending from the practical part, there are several comparisons of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. For example, Sentinel-2 has a 5-day revisit period and collects images at a spatial resolution of 10-20m, whereas Landsat 8 can only be revisited once every 16 days and has a spatial scale of 30m.(Bharathi D, R Karthi, and Geetha P, 2023) Furthermore, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data were compared (Heikki Astola et al., 2019) for their ability to predict forest variables in Southern Finland's boreal forest.They discovered that Sentinel-2 data can be used as the primary Earth observation data source for forest resource assessment.



## Reflections
This week I had learnt a lot about what is remote sensing is and what can we do with it. Furthermore, the in the practical part, I had compared the differences of remote sensing data from different satellites (Sentinel and Landsat) with a new software-SNAP. However, I have to say it is quite hard and time-consuming for me to deal with raster data on SNAP especially drawing out the point of interests part. As I mentioned, this field is completely new to me, so I got to spend more time on this module. Hopefully I will get better in couple weeks! And I am very curious how remote sensing can be related to the building energy performance, I hope I can find the answer in the next couple weeks.
