# Week 5 Google Earth Engine

## Summary
This week we start to talk about GEE!! The diary this week will be mainly focused on the application of GEE.

### What is Google Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine is a useful geographic data processing engine. It makes optimal use of server-side processing and distributed computing to let users handle and analyse massive amounts of geographical data. It makes better use of computational resources by processing data using mapping functions rather than loops. Because of this functionality, Google Earth Engine is one of the most popular systems for handling massive amounts of geospatial data.

### What can we do with GEE
In Google Earth Engine (GEE), we may execute geometric operations, dataset joins, zonal statistics, data filtering, apply machine learning and TensorFlow deep learning algorithms, make online visualisations, and create scalable geospatial apps using GEE data.

### Practical result
In the practical part, we've chosen Delhi as the study area. We loaded the Landsat-9 data of Delhi into GEE. Furthermore, we've done several outputs such as PCA, NDVI and gclm which we've done in the previous practical. It is no doubt that the operation time in GEE is much shorter then we had with R. Moreover, it is more convenient to select the output layer with GEE.

#### NDVI
Comparing with the NDVI which produced with R, the quality of the one from GEE is higher, in addition, the vegetation is shown as green in the following:

#### PCA
In GEE, we've export the PCA output image:

PCA enables us to reduce the dimensions in the image which helps us to extracting the land covers information more efficient. Moreover, It can be viewed that the color of grey is the main component in the image (basically PC1 and PC 2). 

## Applications
As it mentioned in the lecture, GEE is a powerful research tool which enables us to deal with massive geospatial data without spending a lot of time. Moreover, the applications of GEE varies a lot in different fields.For instance, the graph below categorizes the applications of GEE (Haifa Tamiminia et al., 2020):

For example, a research (M. Mohammadi and M. Akhoondzadeh, 2023) had used the Google Earth Engine platform to validate NASA's assertion of a methane cloud near Southern Tehran. Through spatiotemporal analysis of daily data from the TROPOMI sensor, it was confirmed that landfills are the dominant source of methane emissions. As a result, the discovery proved the veracity of NASA's report, owing mostly to the presence of a landfill in the vicinity. Therefore, the Google Earth Engine platform emerges as a valuable tool for tracking daily, monthly, and annual differences. In addition, Daeng and his colleagues (Daeng Achmad Suaidi et al., 2023) used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to analyse Landsat 8 satellite images, successfully tracking the land surface temperature of the Arjuno-Welirang volcanic complex between 2016 and 2021. The data demonstrated a considerable increase in surface temperature in the crater area in 2018, which coincided with increased seismic activity reported by the Volcanological Survey of Indonesia (VSI). This highlights GEE's ability in accurately tracking volcanic activity with readily available satellite data.

## Reflections
GEE is really a efficient tool! It really take less time when I was doing PCA comparing to previous weeks. However, when I run the code in GEE, it always ran the whole code instead of certain trunk. In addition, as it mentioned in the application parts, the GEE got different kinds of applications but the limitations of GEE is quite severe, too. Therefore, it is quite important for us to choose appropriate tools when doing research. When the research is related to SAR data, GEE might not be applicable.
