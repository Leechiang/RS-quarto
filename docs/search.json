    "text": "About me\nHi guys, my name is Chi-Li CHIANG, I’m from Taiwan. I’ve just graduated from my previous study which is Architectural Environment Engineering in the University of Nottingham. As you can see this seemed to be a big pivot from my previous study to Urban Spatial Science. Last year I was doing something like this:\nThe reasons why I did that is because after three years of study, I figured out the fact that our previous investigations on building energy performances are lack of efficiency and convincing quantitative analysis. Therefore, I chose this degree to develop my skills of coding, data processing and analyzing. Since that I got a huge interesting on modeling, so I took Remotely Sensing in this Term. In my point of view, the technique of Remotely Sensing enables us to monitor the lately changes of environment and weather which helps us to develop more energy efficient and sustainable buildings. https://quarto.org/docs/books."

It is periodically updated. The Greater London Authority approved a new London Plan in March 2021 that includes planning for the ensuing 20 to 25 years. Moreover, in the London Plan 2021, there is a Policy G5 Urban greening section which aims to increase the greening coverage in London urban areas. Urban greening includes a variety of options such as street trees, green roofs, green walls, and rain gardens. It can help meet other policy requirements while also providing a variety of benefits such as amenity space, increased biodiversity, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, sustainable drainage, and amenity.\nThe graph below is an example of urban greening (Green wall):"
