    "text": "About me\nHi guys, my name is Chi-Li CHIANG, I’m from Taiwan. I’ve just graduated from my previous study which is Architectural Environment Engineering in the University of Nottingham. As you can see this seemed to be a big pivot from my previous study to Urban Spatial Science. Last year I was doing something like this:  The reasons why I did that is because after three years of study, I figured out the fact that our previous investigations on building energy performances are lack of efficiency and convincing quantitative analysis. Therefore, I chose this degree to develop my skills of coding, data processing and analyzing. Since that I got a huge interesting on modeling, so I took Remotely Sensing in this Term. In my point of view, the technique of Remotely Sensing enables us to monitor the lately changes of environment and weather which helps us to develop more energy efficient and sustainable buildings."

Passive sensors collect radiation emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Active sensors, on the other hand, emits energy to scan objects and areas, after which a sensor detects and measures the radiation reflected or backscattered by the target. \n\n\n1.1.3 Resolutions of remote sensing data\nThere are four categories into which remote sensing data resolutions can be separated: spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric. Resolution is a measurement of the amount of information that is present in a particular image. This includes wavelengths, colours, and pixels that are recorded over a given amount of time; taken together, these make up the richness of the data that is captured. An image provides us with more detailed information and improved visual clarity when it has more pixels, colours, and wavelengths. On the other hand, if these components disappear, the imagery might lose some of its clarity and detail. So, it can be said that resolution is important to the quality of remote sensing data for a range of applications.\n\n\n1.1.4 Practical results\nIn the first week, I learned about how to use SNAP to process Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8data. In addition, Cape Town was chosen as the study area. The graph below is the screenshot of the Sentinel data: \nThen, by comparing the band 4 and band 8 of the target area, a spectural feature space can be made: \n\n\n\nScatter plot\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot"

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nSENTINEL-2, which launched on June 23, 2015, was specifically designed to deliver a large amount of data and imagery. The satellite has an opto-electronic multispectral sensor for surveying with a sentinel-2 resolution of 10 to 60 m in the visible, near infrared (VNIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral zones, including 13 spectral bands, which ensures the capture of differences in vegetation state, including temporal changes, while also minimising the impact on atmospheric photography quality.(Sentinel-2: Satellite imagery, Overview, and characteristics 2024) While Landsat 8 was launched on February 11, 2013. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) are the two scientific instruments that compose up the Landsat 8 satellite payload. The global landmass is covered seasonally by these two sensors at 30 metres (visible, NIR, and SWIR), 100 metres (thermal), and 15 metres (panchromatic) of spatial resolution. (Landsat 8 2023)\nExtending from the practical part, there are several comparisons of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. For example, Sentinel-2 has a 5-day revisit period and collects images at a spatial resolution of 10-20m, whereas Landsat 8 can only be revisited once every 16 days and has a spatial scale of 30m.(Bharathi D, R Karthi, and Geetha P, 2023) Furthermore, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data were compared (Heikki Astola et al., 2019) for their ability to predict forest variables in Southern Finland’s boreal forest.They discovered that Sentinel-2 data can be used as the primary Earth observation data source for forest resource assessment."

It is periodically updated. The Greater London Authority approved a new London Plan in March 2021 that includes planning for the ensuing 20 to 25 years. Moreover, in the London Plan 2021, there is a Policy G5 Urban greening section which aims to increase the greening coverage in London urban areas. Urban greening includes a variety of options such as street trees, green roofs, green walls, and rain gardens. It can help meet other policy requirements while also providing a variety of benefits such as amenity space, increased biodiversity, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, sustainable drainage, and amenity.\nThe graph below is an example of urban greening (Green wall): \nIn order to promote greater and better urban greening, several cities have effectively implemented the “green space factor.”(UGF) The Mayor created a generic Urban Greening Factor model to help boroughs and developers determine the appropriate level of urban greening for new developments.\nThe table below shows some of the factors used to calculate the UGF: \nFor instance, by using the factors above, the UGF can be calculated by: (Factor A x Area) + (Factor B x Area) + (Factor C x Area) etc. divided by Total Site Area. The Mayor recommends a target score of 0.4 for residential developments and 0.3 for commercial development."

    "text": "4.2 Applications\nThe suggested data for supervising the greening area in London is that using the data from Copernicus which the UK involved from 1 January 2024. Due to the fact that the policy not only require the area of greening but also the water features in the city. Therefore, remote sensing might be useful for the London government to verify and monitor. As it concluded by Zehua (2024) in his paper, there are several applications of remote sensing technology. For example, monitoring vegetation with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and laser radar (LiDAR) can aid in monitoring the health and changes of vegetation. Additionally, thermal infrared remote sensing and satellite remote sensing can monitor water quality and level fluctuations. Furthermore, several studies have already been conducted to investigate the use of remote sensing technology to monitor forest areas. A study (Huimian Li et al., 2023) uses single Landsat 8 (L) remote sensing data, single Sentinel-2 (S) remote sensing data, and combined Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (L + S) data as data sources. In addition, four machine learning methods were applied. The study demonstrates that machine learning models based on separate Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data can accurately predict the AGC and spatiotemporal distribution of the Shanghai urban forest. However, the research mentioned above are only focus on distinguishing forest and other land-covers from the map without classifying them with height and species. Instead, a research which done by Turner and his colleagues (DAVID P. TURNER et al., 2004) established a method with the aid of Biome-BGC carbon-cycle process model and repeated remote sensing data for several years, they successfully distinguished the land-cover type and stand age of forest in target areas."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nIn week three, the methods of correction of remote sensed data are introduced. In the summary part, different correction methods are briefly introduced and the enhancement will be dicussed with the practical results.\n\n3.1.1 Correction\nThe correction of remote sensing can be divided into three different type, and this part will be mainly focused on the solutions of these corrections.\n\n3.1.1.1 Geometric correction\nDuring geometric correction, ground control points (GCPs) are collected from various sources like GPS, maps, images, and handheld devices. These points are then compared to the image and a reference dataset. Geometric transformation coefficients are calculated based on the matched GCP coordinates, defining the transformation to map coordinates from the original image to the reference dataset. These coefficients are applied to the image to minimize root mean square error (RMSE), typically aiming for an RMSE of approximately 0.5 through graph plotting and parameter adjustments. Finally, the raster image is resampled using interpolation methods such as nearest neighbor to ensure pixel alignment and accuracy across images.\n\n\n3.1.1.2 Atmospheric correction\nThe atmospheric correction methods aim to reduce atmospheric influences on photographs in order to recover surface features more accurately. They are broadly divided into relative and absolute correction approaches. Empirical Line Correction, a relative approach, uses ground spectral data and linear regression against satellite pictures to estimate surface reflectance. air Radiative Transfer Models, on the other hand, take an absolute approach, using models such as MODTRAN 4+ and 6S to calculate and rectify air interference while accounting for absorption, scattering effects, and path radiance. Another comparable method, Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), involves identifying the image’s darkest pixel values and subtracting them from all pixels to reduce ambient scattering and optical mixing.\n\n\n3.1.1.3 Orthorectification correction / topographic correction:\nOrthorectification correction is a subset of georectification that involves providing geographic coordinates to an image while removing distortions caused by terrain. Its aim is to ensure each pixel appears as if it were captured from directly overhead. To achieve this, sensor geometry information, elevation models, and orthorectification algorithms are utilized. The resulting orthorectified image accurately corresponds each pixel to a specific location on the Earth’s surface, enabling precise analysis of surface features.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Enhancement\n\n3.1.2.1 Ratio enhancement\nThe figure below shows the ratio enhancement of vegetation with the aid of NDVI index (above 0.2): \n\n\n3.1.2.2 Texture enhancement\n Importance of components: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 PC9 Standard deviation 2.6803 1.0174 0.69710 0.36726 0.29467 0.22414 0.10929 0.08835 0.05838 Proportion of Variance 0.7982 0.1150 0.05399 0.01499 0.00965 0.00558 0.00133 0.00087 0.00038 Cumulative Proportion 0.7982 0.9132 0.96721 0.98220 0.99184 0.99743 0.99875 0.99962 1.00000"

    "text": "3.2 Applications\nExtending from the lecture, the applications of correction are not mentioned a lot in the content. However, when I was viewing relevant researches, the application of remote sensing correction varies a lot. For example, a study seeks to provide an effective algorithm for reducing atmospheric interference in remote sensing data by combining publicly available atmospheric correction algorithms with machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches. The objective is to reduce uncertainty in water quality monitoring and improve the accuracy of retrieving optically active water quality indicators by addressing the impact of atmospheric particles, especially aerosols, on remote sensing data.(Mir Talas Mahammad Diganta, Md Galal Uddin, and Agnieszka I. Olbert, 2023) In addition, I have noticed that the methods of correction are not limited with the three method mentioned above. When we download data sets from websites such as USGS, we tried to select data sets with 0 cloud cover, this procedure might filter out most of the data. In order to prevent this, I’ve discovered a research which done by Zhang and his colleague (Chi Zhang et al., 2023)， they developed a method for removing thin clouds from remote sensing images to improve the quality of ground surface information. The method combines an enhanced approach for locally estimating ambient light with a spectral transformation scheme to generate intermediate images and estimate transmission maps.Experiments conducted on a range of satellite photos demonstrated that the suggested approach is better than the state-of-the-art algorithms, producing images with less clouds and more accurate recovery of ground surface information. Moreover, a research had investigated the method of enhancing land surface temperature (LST) data (Qi Mao, Jian Peng, and Yanglin Wang, 2021), in which Three types of enhancement techniques were thoroughly examined: simultaneous spatiotemporal resolution enhancement, temporal enhancement, and spatial enhancement. The study also covered approaches for evaluating quality and suggested avenues for future investigation, such as combining data-driven and process-driven approaches, developing cross-referencing tools, and improving localization tactics."

It is my first time to now that the remote sensing data we used got a lot limitations and potentials. Fortunately, Andy had mentioned that the remote sensing products nowadays are corrected. But, it is important to learn the principles of it.It is a bit of a pity that in the practical part, we’ve only focus on the atmospheric correction. And in the enhancement part, it is very interesting to enhance the particular texture in a remote sensing image which enable us to know What topography or composition is it made of. In addition, I’m quite curious and look forward to learning about Google Earth Engine because when I do enhancement in the practical, it took me a lot of time to run the code in R."
