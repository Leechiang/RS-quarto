## Summary

### The London Plan 2021

The Greater London Authority publishes the London Plan, which is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom, and is authored by the Mayor of London. It is periodically updated. The Greater London Authority approved a new London Plan in March 2021 that includes planning for the ensuing 20 to 25 years. Moreover, in the London Plan 2021, there is a Policy G5 Urban greening section which aims to increase the greening coverage in London urban areas. Urban greening includes a variety of options such as street trees, green roofs, green walls, and rain gardens.    It can help meet other policy requirements while also providing a variety of benefits such as amenity space, increased biodiversity, mitigation of the urban heat island effect, sustainable drainage, and amenity.

The graph below is an example of urban greening (Green wall):

In order to promote greater and better urban greening, several cities have effectively implemented the "green space factor."(UGF)    The Mayor created a generic Urban Greening Factor model to help boroughs and developers determine the appropriate level of urban greening for new developments.
