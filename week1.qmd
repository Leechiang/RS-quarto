# Week 1

## Summary
In this part, the content of the lecture will not be summarized in detail. Instead, the terms and basic topics discussed in the lecture will be included.

### Introducing remote sensing
Remote sensing unlike on-site observation, it involves gathering data about an object or phenomenon without coming into direct contact with it.

#### Types of remote sensing
Furthermore, the types of remote sensing can be divided into passive and active. Passive sensors collect radiation emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Active sensors, on the other hand, emits energy to scan objects and areas, after which a sensor detects and measures the radiation reflected or backscattered by the target.

#### Resolutions of remote sensing data
The resolutions of remote sensing data can be divided into four types:
1. Spatial


## Applications
In the applications part, I will mainly focus on sharing the practical result of first week.In the first week, I learned about how to use SNAP to process Sentinel 2 data. In addition, Cape Town was chosen as the study area. The graph below is the screenshot of the Sentinel data:

Then, by comparing the band 4 and band 8 of the target area, a spectural feature space can be made:
