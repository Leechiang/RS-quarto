However, in order to keep the diary short and try to cover up more details as I can, the content of the lectures will not be fully summarized, instead, some of them will be discussed with my practical results.\n\n### Introducing remote sensing\nRemote sensing unlike on-site observation, it involves gathering data about an object or phenomenon without coming into direct contact with it. \n\n![Remote sensing](img/Remote-Sensing-Process.jpg)\n\n### Types of remote sensing\nThe types of remote sensing can be divided into passive and active. Passive sensors collect radiation emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding areas. Active sensors, on the other hand, emits energy to scan objects and areas, after which a sensor detects and measures the radiation reflected or backscattered by the target.\n![Types](img/Types of remote sensing.jpg)\n\n### Resolutions of remote sensing data\nThere are four categories into which remote sensing data resolutions can be separated: spatial, spectral, temporal, and radiometric. Resolution is a measurement of the amount of information that is present in a particular image. This includes wavelengths, colours, and pixels that are recorded over a given amount of time; taken together, these make up the richness of the data that is captured. An image provides us with more detailed information and improved visual clarity when it has more pixels, colours, and wavelengths. On the other hand, if these components disappear, the imagery might lose some of its clarity and detail. So, it can be said that resolution is important to the quality of remote sensing data for a range of applications.\n\n### Practical results\nIn the first week, I learned about how to use SNAP to process Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 data. In addition, Cape Town was chosen as the study area. The graph below is the screenshot of the Sentinel data:\n![Sentinel data](img/屏幕截图 2024-02-15 200519.jpg)\n\n\nThen, by comparing the band 4 and band 8 of the target area, a spectural feature space can be made:\n![Scatter plot](img/240216.jpg)\nIn addition, it is interesting to downscale the sentinel image from 10m to 30m and compare the two images because Landsat 8 owns wider range of spectral bands, so we use Landsat 8 to check the land covers and draw point of interests in Sentinel 8 image on SNAP. After processing the polygons we've drawn, several plots can be made.\nFrom the density plot below, it can be viewed the band values of each land cover. Moreover, the mean values of each band are plot in the graph with vertical lines:\n![Density plot](img/00002.jpg)\n\n![Spectral profiles](img/000010.jpg)\n\n## Applications\nSENTINEL-2, which launched on June 23, 2015, was specifically designed to deliver a large amount of data and imagery. The satellite has an opto-electronic multispectral sensor for surveying with a sentinel-2 resolution of 10 to 60 m in the visible, near infrared (VNIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral zones, including 13 spectral bands, which ensures the capture of differences in vegetation state, including temporal changes, while also minimising the impact on atmospheric photography quality.(Sentinel-2: Satellite imagery, Overview, and characteristics 2024) While Landsat 8 was launched on February 11, 2013.  The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and the Operational Land Imager (OLI) are the two scientific instruments that compose up the Landsat 8 satellite payload.   The global landmass is covered seasonally by these two sensors at 30 metres (visible, NIR, and SWIR), 100 metres (thermal), and 15 metres (panchromatic) of spatial resolution. (Landsat 8 2023)\n\nExtending from the practical part, there are several comparisons of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. For example, Sentinel-2 has a 5-day revisit period and collects images at a spatial resolution of 10-20m, whereas Landsat 8 can only be revisited once every 16 days and has a spatial scale of 30m.(Bharathi D, R Karthi, and Geetha P, 2023) Furthermore, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data were compared (Heikki Astola et al., 2019) for their ability to predict forest variables in Southern Finland's boreal forest.They discovered that Sentinel-2 data can be used as the primary Earth observation data source for forest resource assessment.\n\n\n\n## Reflections\nThis week I had learnt a lot about what is remote sensing is and what can we do with it. Furthermore, the in the practical part, I had compared the differences of remote sensing data from different satellites (Sentinel and Landsat) with a new software-SNAP. We've taken the advantages from them and done analysis. However, I have to say it is quite hard and time-consuming for me to deal with raster data on SNAP especially drawing out the point of interests part. As I mentioned, this field is completely new to me, so I got to spend more time on this module. Hopefully I will get better in couple weeks! And I am very curious how remote sensing can be related to the building energy performance, I hope I can find the answer in the next couple weeks.\n\n## Reference\nSentinel-2: Satellite imagery, Overview, and characteristics (2024) EOS Data Analytics.
