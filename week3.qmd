# Week 3

## Summary
In week three, the methods of correction of remote sensed data are introduced. In the summary part, different correction methods are briefly introduced and the enhancement will be dicussed with the practical results.

### Correction

The correction of remote sensing can be divided into three different type, and this part will be mainly focused on the solutions of these corrections.

#### Geometric correction

During geometric correction, ground control points (GCPs) are collected from various sources like GPS, maps, images, and handheld devices. These points are then compared to the image and a reference dataset. Geometric transformation coefficients are calculated based on the matched GCP coordinates, defining the transformation to map coordinates from the original image to the reference dataset. These coefficients are applied to the image to minimize root mean square error (RMSE), typically aiming for an RMSE of approximately 0.5 through graph plotting and parameter adjustments. Finally, the raster image is resampled using interpolation methods such as nearest neighbor to ensure pixel alignment and accuracy across images.

#### Atmospheric correction

The atmospheric correction methods aim to reduce atmospheric influences on photographs in order to recover surface features more accurately. They are broadly divided into relative and absolute correction approaches. Empirical Line Correction, a relative approach, uses ground spectral data and linear regression against satellite pictures to estimate surface reflectance. air Radiative Transfer Models, on the other hand, take an absolute approach, using models such as MODTRAN 4+ and 6S to calculate and rectify air interference while accounting for absorption, scattering effects, and path radiance. Another comparable method, Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), involves identifying the image's darkest pixel values and subtracting them from all pixels to reduce ambient scattering and optical mixing.

#### Orthorectification correction / topographic correction:
Orthorectification correction is a subset of georectification that involves providing geographic coordinates to an image while removing distortions caused by terrain.   Its aim is to ensure each pixel appears as if it were captured from directly overhead.   To achieve this, sensor geometry information, elevation models, and orthorectification algorithms are utilized.   The resulting orthorectified image accurately corresponds each pixel to a specific location on the Earth's surface, enabling precise analysis of surface features.
